# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository! Here you’ll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, organized by year and day.

## Project Structure

The repository follows this folder structure:
```
advent-of-code/
├── YYYY/
│   ├── DD-TITLE/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   └── main.rs         # Solution code for the day’s puzzle
│   │   ├── input.txt           # Input data for the day’s puzzle
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml          # Rust package configuration
│   │   └── README.md           # Explanation of the solution
│   └── …
└── README.md
```

Each folder represents a specific year and day of the challenge, with subdirectories named by the day and title of the puzzle. Inside each `DD-TITLE` folder:
- `src/main.rs`: Contains the Rust solution code.
- `input.txt`: Holds the puzzle input data.
- `Cargo.toml`: Manages dependencies and configuration.
- `README.md`: Includes a detailed explanation of the solution approach.

This structure is designed to support a Rust project setup for each day’s challenge, making it easy to compile and run each solution independently.

## How to Use

1. Install Rust and Toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/) recommended)
2. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/risk1996/advent-of-code.git
```
3. Navigate to the Solution Folder:
```bash
cd advent-of-code/YYYY/DD-TITLE
```
4. Run the Solution with Cargo:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
